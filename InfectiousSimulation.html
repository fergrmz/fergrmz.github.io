									<h1>Infectious Disease Simulation</h1>
									<p>C++ simulation to model infectious disease spread, incorporating infection, vaccination, and mutation.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/disease.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This project aimed to model the spread of infectious diseases within a population using C++. By developing a detailed simulation, the project explored various factors influencing disease dynamics, including infection, vaccination, mutation, and person-to-person interactions. The simulation began with basic classes for individuals and diseases, progressively incorporating more complexity such as random interactions, a 2D grid population model, and the introduction of mutation dynamics to reflect real-world scenarios. The project emphasized the importance of explicit simulations over statistical models to provide a nuanced understanding of disease progression and control measures.</p>
								<p>The methodology involved creating a Person class to represent individuals, with attributes tracking their health status and recovery. The Disease class was designed to include parameters for transmission probability and duration. As the project advanced, a Population class was introduced to model a group of individuals, facilitating simulations of disease spread through contact and vaccination strategies. The simulations were tested rigorously, ensuring that the behavior of the model aligned with expected outcomes, such as verifying the effects of vaccination and the impact of transmission probabilities on disease spread. Advanced features like random interactions and mutations were added, simulating real-world disease propagation and adaptation.</p>
								<p>Throughout the project, I gained significant insights into coding and implementation. The process involved not only developing the simulation but also debugging and optimizing the code to handle large populations and complex interactions efficiently. This experience deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming and reinforced the importance of thorough testing and validation. Additionally, writing the report honed my ability to document and communicate technical processes and results clearly, highlighting the ethical considerations and real-world applications of disease modeling. Overall, this project enhanced my programming skills and provided a comprehensive understanding of infectious disease dynamics.</p>

									<h1>Proposed Space Mission</h1>
									<p>Theoretical mission to deploy a constellation of GPS satellites in Mars orbit.</p>

								<p>I undertook the challenge of conceptualizing a space mission aimed at launching four satellites into Mars orbit to establish a GPS navigation constellation. These satellites would play a crucial role in facilitating future manned missions and rover explorations on the Martian surface by providing real-time navigation data. Drawing inspiration from existing space missions such as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and MAVEN, as well as GPS III and IIIF satellites, I meticulously designed the mission architecture and spacecraft systems to ensure the successful deployment and operation of the satellite constellation.</p>
								<p>My responsibilities encompassed a wide range of tasks, from conducting heritage research on previous space missions to estimating mass budgets for the spacecraft and propulsion systems. Leveraging the principles of systems engineering, I meticulously calculated the mass, cost, and power estimates for various components, including propulsion systems, communications systems, power systems, and structural elements. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into the intricate planning and design considerations involved in space missions, learning to balance technical requirements, performance objectives, and resource constraints to achieve mission success.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, this project provided me with a hands-on experience in applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, honing my skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By navigating through the complexities of mission planning, I developed a deeper appreciation for the multifaceted nature of space exploration and the importance of meticulous planning and analysis in ensuring the success of such endeavors.</p>

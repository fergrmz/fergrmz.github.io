								<p>In this project, my team and I reverse-engineered a flying disc launcher to thoroughly understand its design and functionality. Our primary goal was to analyze and improve the existing product, considering both the customer’s and engineer’s perspectives. We evaluated aspects like durability, safety, and cost-effectiveness, ensuring that the toy was both appealing to children and safe for use. The project involved dissecting the launcher, analyzing its components, and creating detailed engineering documentation, including specifications, exploded assembly sketches, and finite element analysis (FEA).</p>

								<p>We approached the reverse engineering process methodically, starting with a detailed dissection of the launcher using tools like a Phillips head screwdriver. Each component was carefully analyzed for material properties, manufacturing methods, and functionality. For instance, the 3-blade propeller, a critical component, was evaluated for its mass properties and center of mass to ensure optimal performance. The FEA was conducted on the trigger to assess its durability under various forces, ensuring it could withstand repeated use without failure. The analysis highlighted potential improvements, such as changing materials to polypropylene for better safety and adjusting the propeller's blade design for enhanced aerodynamics.</p>

								<p>Through this project, I gained invaluable experience in engineering principles, 3D modeling, and analysis. Leading the team, I honed my leadership skills, coordinating tasks and ensuring timely completion of each phase. The practical application of 3D modeling software allowed us to redesign components effectively, improving the launcher's performance and safety. This project also reinforced the importance of a customer-centric approach in engineering design, balancing functionality, and user safety while maintaining cost efficiency. Overall, this hands-on experience provided a comprehensive understanding of product design, reverse engineering, and the critical evaluation of consumer products.</p>
